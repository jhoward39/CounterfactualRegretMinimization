# TLDR: This is the training algorithm used to beat humans in texas hold em' (poker). It's a visualisation of it on a small scale using javascript, html, and css.

# Overview
I was overly blessed to study abroad at Oxford University. While I was there I picked up the poker bug at the Oxford Poker Society. The organisation (notice the spelling) of roughly 35-50 students meet weekly for low-stakes cash games somewhere on campus, try getting that approved at a Jesuit institution like Fordham. It was beautiful, on each hand we could use calculators to check the pot odds at the table. After Oxford, I stayed in Europe for 8 weeks. I traveled to a new city every other day with a Eurorail pass, staying in hostels, and playing poker in every damn city. There were swings, but I stayed extremely patient and only played when I knew there was a profitable strategy to execute. After 8 weeks I had profited $3,220 (after conversion fees). I had spent, $5,800 on the entire trip including Oxford and the subsequent 8 weeks. Not bad. 

This is where I became interested in the science that beat humans in the game of texas hold em' developed by Noam Brown https://noambrown.github.io/. Before developing the programs that beat professionals at the game of no limit texas hold em, he was an algo trader at MJM here in new york. He now works as a research scientist at Meta. This project came from my fascination with his work. This work was followed by Eric Steinberger's algorithm, single-deep counterfactual regret minimization, another hero of mine. This implementation follows Noam Brown's algorithm.


# Situation
Maaheen wants to learn about the algorithms we have to solve imperfect information games. Maaheen can log into this site, click run, and see a colorful, iterative visualization of the algorithm as it traverses the game tree, creating a strategy for each action point. Well, Maaheen should look elsewhere because this project is nowhere near good enough to call complete. 

The underlying algorithm is in javascript. I don't know what I was thinking...
