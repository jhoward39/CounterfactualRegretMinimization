The interactivity is still in the works. After hitting trained and waiting 30 seconds this is what one will see.

This is the vanilla implementation of this algorithm. In order to handle big imperfect information games one needs to opt for the more efficient Deep CFR(Noam Brown 2018) or Single-Deep CFR(Eric Steinberger 2019)
